# CChess
An abstract implementation of Chess in C++.
Currently in development. Dev View is in Ncurses, on Linux based operating systems. 

Compile Command: make

Run command: ./CChess 

Currently only builds on Linux or WSL with KeX.
Plans to create a Windows API based interface for download.
Plans to integrate with Web Assembly for a future web project, combining with one of my preexisting web socket based chat servers.
